This is a simple, garbage program to track when users have been "burgled" by another institution, because this always, for some unfathomable and illogical reason; silently removes them from all lookup groups for the original institution.


Which means that user accounts silently break on multiple-employment scenarios, or if a new in-University employer doesn't set an appropriate start date for their new starter in a Jackdaw request.
